1) To use this program you must simply input the name of the txt file you want to spell check. 
   (write the name of the file without the ".txt" extension)
2) The program will then automatically skip all the correct words if their inside of the default dictionary
   otherwise it will give you 3 guesses based on the word that you misspelt and then you as the user 
   are required to select between options using the numbers (from 1-3) to take one of the guessed words
   or to choose number 4 to keep the word as is. press enter.(repeat till software closes)
3) After all words are selected the program will then write a folder with the same name as the inputted
   folder but with the suffix "_correct" after the name.
4) now you can enjoy your corrected text document :)
